## 1. Data set loaded
Here we have loaded the traing set and testing set first. After loading the testing and trainig data sets, in order to get done the data cleaning part at once we have combined two data sets together.
To combine the data sets the no of columns should be the same. Since the testing set doesn't contains the Sales Prices column, we have added the sales prices column explicitly. After that we have cleaned the data using the combined data set.
